# how it works:
1- Players: The game involves two players, referred to as "Player 1" and "Player 2". The current scores for each player are displayed next to their names.

2- Turn-based Gameplay: The game follows a turn-based system, where each player takes turns to roll the dice and accumulate points.

3- Rolling the Dice: To start their turn, a player clicks on the "Roll dice" button. This triggers the roll of a virtual six-sided dice, and a random number between 1 and 6 is generated.

4- Accumulating Points: The number rolled on the dice represents the points earned in that turn. If a player rolls any number from 2 to 6, 
those points are added to their current score. However, if a player rolls a 1, they lose all the points accumulated in that turn, and their turn ends.

5- Holding Points: After rolling the dice, a player can choose to "Hold" their points by clicking on the "Hold" button. This adds the points earned in that turn to their total score. 
It also ends their turn, and it becomes the other player's turn.

6- Winning the Game: The game continues with each player taking turns until one of the players reaches or exceeds the target score, which is typically 100 points. 
When a player reaches the target score, they are declared the winner, and a celebratory message like "You won ðŸŽ‰" is displayed next to their name.

7- New Game: To start a new game, players can click on the "New game" button. This resets the scores and allows the players to begin a fresh game.
